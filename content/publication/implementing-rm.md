abstract = "The  density  of  NAND  flash  grows  at  the  price  of  significantly reduced reliability. To enable the continued scaling of flash memory more  fundamental  changes  are  needed.  In  this  paper,  we  show  that flash  is  much  more  reliable by  adopting  the rank modulation (RM) scheme. RM encodes data using the relative orders of memory cell voltages, which is inherently resilient to asymmetric errors. However, the  practical  performance  of  RM  is  still  unknown  due  to  the  lack of implementation  studies.  This  work  has  multiple  contributions  on the  practical  aspects  of  RM,  which  include:  1)  Adaptations  that make  RM  implementable  using  existing  NAND  flash  memories.  2) Characterization  of  the  first  RM  implementation  using  20nm  MLC from two vendors. 3) An application of RM to archival storage, and its performance evaluation using 16nm MLC. 4) An implementation-friendly VLSI architecture of an NAND flash memory based on RM."
