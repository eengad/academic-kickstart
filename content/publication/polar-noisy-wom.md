abstract = "We consider the noisy write-once memory (WOM) model to capture the behavior of data-storage devices such as flash memories. The noisy WOM is an asymmetric channel model with non-causal state information at the encoder. We show that a nesting of non-linear polar codes achieves the corresponding Gelfand-Pinsker bound with polynomial complexity."
