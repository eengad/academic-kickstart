abstract = "Disclosed are constructions of WOM codes that combine rewriting and error correction for mitigating the reliability and the endurance problems typically experienced with flash memory. A rewriting model is considered that is of practical interest to flash memory applications where only the second write uses WOM codes. The disclosed WOM code construction is based on binary erasure quantization with LDGM codes, where the rewriting uses message passing and has potential to share the efficient hardware implementations with LDPC codes in practice. The coding scheme achieves the capacity of the rewriting model."
