abstract = "Both rewriting and error correction are technologies usable for non-volatile memories, such as flash memories. A coding scheme is disclosed herein that combines rewriting and error correction for the write-once memory model. In some embodiments, code construction is based on polar codes, and supports any number of rewrites and corrects a substantial number of errors. The code may be analyzed for a binary symmetric channel. The results can be extended to multi-level cells and more general noise models."
